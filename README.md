# DistractionFreeYoutube

Browse YouTube with all your playlists in a custom UI without having the extra distractions of shorts or recommendations.

_This is a WIP. I wanted a program similar to the Invidious project, but focused on productivity and integrated with my YouTube account instead of a focus on user privacy._

## Setup

```
sudo docker-compose up
```

## Example UI
